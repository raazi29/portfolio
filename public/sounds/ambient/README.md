## Creating "Subtle" Versions

To create subtle versions of Star Wars themes:
1. Start with the original theme
2. Lower the volume significantly (around -12dB to -18dB)
3. Apply a slight reverb effect to make it more ambient
4. Consider applying a low-pass filter to reduce higher frequencies
5. Fade in and out at the beginning and end to allow for smooth looping

## Note

These ambient sounds are played at a very low volume when the corresponding lightsaber sound font is selected and the "Ambient Sounds" option is enabled in the settings panel.

Please ensure all sound files are properly licensed for use in your project. The Star Wars themes are copyrighted by Lucasfilm/Disney, so for a production environment, you should either:
1. Obtain proper licensing
2. Use royalty-free alternatives that evoke a similar mood
3. Create original compositions inspired by the themes
